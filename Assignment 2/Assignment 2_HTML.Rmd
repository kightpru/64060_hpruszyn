## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
## The purpose of this assignment is to use k-NN for classification. The task is to design a smarter marketing campaign for Universal Bank, a young, growing bank that aims to target customers who are most likely to accept a loan offer. 

## UniversalBank.csv contains data for 5,000 customers, including demographics, product utilization, and response to the last personal loan campaign (9.6% positive). 

library(dplyr)
library(class)
library(caret)
library(ISLR)


## Create a dataset excluding ID and ZIP (Age, Experience, Income, Family, CCAvg, Education, Mortgage, PersonalLoan, SecuritiesAccount, CDAccount, Online,CreditCard)
## (I feel sure there's a way to call all the column headers and/or remove just columns 1 and 4, but I can't remember how.)
universal <- read.csv("UniversalBank.csv")
m_universal <- universal[,-c(1, 5)]
summary(m_universal)

## Transform categorical predictors with more than two categories into dummy variables.
## (Education)
```


```{r}
m_universal$Education <- as.factor(m_universal$Education)
levels(m_universal$Education)
dummy_model <- dummyVars(~Education, data=m_universal)
dummy_model <- predict(dummy_model, m_universal)

m_universal <- cbind(m_universal%>%select(-Education),dummy_model)

```


```{r}
norm_model <- preProcess(m_universal %>% select(-Personal.Loan), method = c("center", "scale"))
  norm_final <- predict(norm_model, m_universal %>% select(-Personal.Loan))

  summary(norm_final)
```


```{r}
## Partition the data into training (60%) and validation (40%) sets. 
set.seed(123)
train_index <- createDataPartition(m_universal$Age,p=0.6, list=FALSE) ## 60% of rows
train_data <- m_universal[train_index,]
valid_data <- m_universal[-train_index,] ## remainder of rows (40%)

summary(train_data)
summary(valid_data)
```


```{r}
## Normalize the data with a model.



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
